# AIPI510_Module_Project_1
This will be Project 1 for AIPI 510.

Rough Draft Phase:
Project:
What is the biggest difference between Forecasted and Actual demand and what regions are those underdemand areas? Why are they like that?

Steps:
1. Take Data from 2015 by subregion and put it all together.
2. Figure out what the data means
3. Conduct Exporatory Analysis
  
5. Clean the data.
   a. So take out unneccessary columns (only keep UTC Time at the enbd of hour at the end of the hour for times because we can use this to tell us everything else.
   b. take out empty columns or columns with NaN values

Submission Deliverables:
1. Public Communication Deliverable (submitted as link)
   Must include:
   A clear and engaging title
   An explanation of why this story matters and who it's for (your audience)
   Key findings supported by visualizations and examples
   Discussion of data limitations, bias, and ethical implications (in accessible language)
   A compelling narrative arcâ€”what surprised you? What should we take away?
2. GitHub Repository (submitted as link)
   Must include:
   All code used for preprocessing, EDA, and feature engineering (scripts, not just notebooks)
   A README with:
      Overview of your project
      Dataset description and citation
      Step-by-step instructions to reproduce your analysis
      Use of branches and pull requests
   Each group member must make at least one PR
      Use best practices for reviews and commits
   Raw and cleaned data (or, if restricted, a clear description of how to access/generate it)
5. Presentation (8 minutes max) (presented in class on Sep 30th)
  Must inlcude:
      Your audience and why this story matters
      Your dataset and topic of interest
      Key trends and visualizations uncovered during EDA
      Any engineered features that shaped your analysis
      The story your data tells and its ethical implications
      Final takeaways

Brainstorming Phase:
Scope
What: Electricty Demand in MegaWatt Hours
Where: This will be in U.S. Lower 48 (the ones on the traditional map)
When: from 2015 - now

1. Power grid data
   This would be a three phase process:
   Phase 1: We would be identifying where the week points are currently and in the future in our energy grid and by how much. We would also be predicting where the week points will be. It will account for the injestion of electric cars intop the power grid and flying supersonic and these new data centers.
   Phase 2: Then we would predict how much energy we should input into the grid with nuclear power and whether that would be enough with the introduction of electric cars and our projection for the energy we should need.(AIPI 510)

Resources:
1. Data to find out what where the week points currently are

Questions:
1. Are there toehr sources opf data that we coudl also use to help with this?
Yes we can use carbon emmission data to als help 

Things to know

Top weaknesses in infrastructue
1. Aging infrastructure
2. Cyber Vulnberabilities
3. Extreme weatehr and climate exposure
4. Renewable integration challenges

How it works:

Solutions right now?
Decentralized power like Decentralized Energy Resources
Weaknesses here ripple into national security, economic resilience, and climate adaptation

   Then we would go back and take the perspective of General Matter on Uranium Enrichment (Scott Nolan) and make recommendations on where exactly to put theses power plants. That decision would be optimizing where it wopuld have the biggest impact on the energy grid, allow for the most growth based on state law and minimze the enemy's ability to havce a significant impact on out energy grid.

5. Solving the debt problem
6. Sex trafficking

Option 2: Measuring power if we really want to go all out
In this competition with the U.S. and China, we need to optimize to stay the world power right now and ensure that we will continue to be. How do we do this? It starts with understanding where we are at now. Currently The NAtional Intelligence COunciul uses a blend of GDP< R&D,spoending, population and military capability to measure power. But they're so off and we can do such a better job than that. Our solution? A Multivariate Integrated Model combining Class Realsim Gross INdicators (GDP, Military Spending, population, land area, industrial output), Beckley's Framework with Net Resource Models to subtract liabilities (poverties, internal instability). It will continue to add.\
