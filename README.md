# AIPI510_Module_Project_1
This will be Project 1 for AIPI 510.
Brainstorming Phase
Scope
What: Electricty Demand in MegaWatt Hours
Where: This will be in U.S. Lower 48 (the ones on the traditional map)
When: from 2015 - now

1. Power grid data
   This would be a three phase process:
   Phase 1: We would be identifying where the week points are currently and in the future in our energy grid and by how much. We would also be predicting where the week points will be. It will account for the injestion of electric cars intop the power grid and flying supersonic and these new data centers.
   Phase 2: Then we would predict how much energy we should input into the grid with nuclear power and whether that would be enough with the introduction of electric cars and our projection for the energy we should need.(AIPI 510)

Resources:
1. Data to find out what where the week points currently are
https://www.eia.gov/electricity/gridmonitor/dashboard/electric_overview/US48/US48

Questions:
1. Are there toehr sources opf data that we coudl also use to help with this?
Yes we can use carbon emmission data to als help 

Things to know

Top weaknesses in infrastructue
1. Aging infrastructure
2. Cyber Vulnberabilities
3. Extreme weatehr and climate exposure
4. Renewable integration challenges

Solutions right now?
Decentralized power like Decentralized Energy Resources
Weaknesses here ripple into national security, economic resilience, and climate adaptation

   Then we would go back and take the perspective of General Matter on Uranium Enrichment (Scott Nolan) and make recommendations on where exactly to put theses power plants. That decision would be optimizing where it wopuld have the biggest impact on the energy grid, allow for the most growth based on state law and minimze the enemy's ability to havce a significant impact on out energy grid.
